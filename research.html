		<p><b>Area and Energy Efficient Embedded Processor</b>
		</p>
		<p>
The goal of this research is to design a embedded processor to meet several constraints such as circuit area, power, and energy. Recently, we developed a framework to generate application specific embedded processor while area, power, and performance can be traded-off. The framework consists of a non-pipelined host processor, and a one instruction set co-processor. The host processor can be tailored for any application while the co-processor supports other instructions of the ISA. While more and more instructions are off-loaded to the co-processor the size of the host-processor will be shrinking. As a result, the processor designer can manage the performance of the processor with circuit area and power consumption. Experimental results have shown that our framework can generate processor, which is 5x smaller than a 5-stage pipeline MIPS processor with 75% less power consumption.

		<p><b>ISA Extension for Accelerating Sequential Code on Single Core</b></p>
		<p>
In practice, most ISA extension works extract a sequence of instructions and replace them with one large unit, and reduce the cycle counts. However, this affects the overall clock frequency. Another technique to improve the clock frequency is using smaller data-path for example a 16-bit wide ALU. However, this increase the instruction count results long execution time. Unlike these above two techniques our approach is rather combining the instruction exploration while taking the benefit of the narrower data-path. We explore the operation and replace the large or wider instruction with a smaller but more powerful one. As a result, higher clock frequency is achieved without increasing the instruction count. Experimental result of our proposed ISA extension has shown that there is 29% performance improvement in performance with 8% reduction in circuit area and 48% energy savings.
