			<h2>Employment</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Tokyo Institute of Technology</b><br>
				<b>Visiting Researcher, Dept. of Communications and Computer Engineering (Since Apr. 2016)</b><br>
				Work on developing reliable and ultra low power processor architecture to detect different types of fault (permanent, timing, and transient) on-the-fly. Different software and hardware techniques are applied to compensate the effect of fault on the performance, circuit area, and power consumption. Besides, I am also working with some of Prof. Yuko Hara-Azumiâ€™s students on different hardware and software projects on approximate computing.<br><br>
				<b>SBI BITS Co. Ltd.</b><br>
				<b>Platform Acceleration Architect, Strategic Software Development (Apr. 2016 - Aug. 2016)</b><br>
				I worked on all phases of FPGA development including high level system architecture, RTL implementation, implementation strategies, floor planning, and related software development for efficient hardware implementation. I particularly involved in developing a novel financial risk analysis architecture for FPGA, and providing API for the software developer to access the FPGA resource. I was applying several architectural techniques to overcome the physical limitations of FPGA (such as maximum use of DSP block, applying proper pipelineing). In addition to these, I was also working on developing a framework which convert the legacy C/C++ application for the Altera OpenCL SDK. <br><br>
				<b>Tokyo Institute of Technology</b><br>
				<b>Researcher, Dept. of Communications and Computer Engineering (Apr. 2014 - Apr. 2016)</b><br>
				Worked on two different research direction: (1) design and implementation of energy efficient and low cost embedded processor. The processor was described in C language, which cab be synthesized by any commercial or open-source HLS tools. I exploreed efficient C coding style to produce small and energy efficient circuits. In addition to that different architectural techniques were also taken into account for smaller and low power design; (2) investigated efficient hardware and software techniques to detect and recover both permanent and timing faults. These techniques covered a wide range of processor architectrues such as small scale embedded processor, high-end commercial processor, and reconfigurable processor.<br><br>
				<b>Nara Institute of Science and Technology</b><br>
				<b>Research Assitant, Graduate School of Information Science (Jun. 2011 - Mar. 2014)</b><br>
				I had worked on to reduce the hardware overhead to detect permanent fault in a fault-tolerable reconfigurable architectrue. In addition to detecting the permanent fault, I explored an efficient technique to predict transient fault rate, while the processor was operating with minimal redundancy. Based on the predicted error rate future redundancy was selected<br><br>
				<b>Linkoping University</b><br>
				<b>Master Thesis Student, Dept. of Electrical Engineering (Oct. 2010 - May 2011)</b><br>
				Worked on implementing a high-throughput and low power FFT processors on ASIC for wireless communication applications. Different optimization techniques (both architectural and implementation) have been applied to meet the timing and power constraints
